            <p class="subheading">Computer Engineering student at Politecnico di Torino</p>
            <p class="bio">
                I have always had a strong passion for tech and problem-solving, and this passion has driven me to pursue a career in computer engineering.
                I have experience in programming languages such as C, Python, and Java/Kotlin. I enjoy working on projects that blend software and hardware to solve real-world problems. 
                Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work with a cybersecurity company called H.

            <p class="projects-description">
                As part of my study into combined hardware/software solutions, I created a smart home system.
                <br>
                The system used sensors to detect changes in the environment and a raspberry pi to make decisions on what to change. It also had an integrated security system based on cameras and motion sensors.
                <br><br>
                Features:
                <ul>
                    <li>Turn watering systems on/off</li>
                    <li>Adjust lights based on presence and time of day</li>
                    <li>Room-specific heating and cooling</li>
                    <li>Automated coffee making</li>
                    <li>Security system using motion sensors</li>
                    <li>Energy-efficient appliance control</li>
