            <h2 class="subtitle">Computer Engineering student at Politecnico di Torino</h2>
            <p class="about-text">
                I have always had a strong passion for tech and problem solving, and this passion has driven me to
                pursue a career in computer engineering.
                <br />
                I have experience in programming languages such as C, Python, and Java/Kotlin. I enjoy working on projects
                that blend software and hardware to solve real-world problems.
                <br />
                Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work with a cybersecurity company called H.

            <p class="project-description">
                As part of my study into combined hardware/software solutions, I created a smart home system. The system
                used sensors to detect changes in the environment and a Raspberry Pi to make decisions on what to change.
                It also had an integrated security system based on cameras and motion sensors.
