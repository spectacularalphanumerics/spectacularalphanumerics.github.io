I have experience in programming languages such as C, Python, and Java/Kotlin. I enjoy working on projects that blend software and hardware to solve real-world problems 

I’ve had the opportunity to work with a cybersecurity company called H </span></div><div class="v1_635"><div class="v1_636"><div class="v1_640"><span class="v1_641">Button</span></div></div></div><div class="v1_643"><div class="v1_644"><span class="v1_645">Topic</span><span class="v1_646">Page</span><span class="v1_647">Page</span><span class="v1_648">Page</span></div><div class="v1_649"><span class="v1_650">Topic</span><span class="v1_651">Page</span><span class="v1_652">Page</span><span class="v1_653">Page</span></div><div class="v1_654"><span class="v1_655">Topic</span><span class="v1_656">Page</span><span class="v1_657">Page</span><span class="v1_658">Page</span></div><span class="v1_659">Site name</span><div class="v1_660"><div class="v1_661"><div class="v1_662"><div class="name"></div></div></div><div class="v1_666"><div class="v1_667"><div class="name"></div></div></div><div class="v1_671"><div class="v1_672"><div class="name"></div></div></div><div class="v1_676"><div class="v1_677"><div class="name"></div></div></div></div><div class="name"></div></div><div class="v1_701"><span class="v1_702">Contact me:</span></div><span class="v1_1045">s342027@protonmail.com

</span><div class="v2_2"><span class="v2_5">As part of my study into combined hardware/software solutions I created a smart home system.

The system used sensors to detect changes in the environment and a raspberry pi to make decisions on what to change. It also had an integrated security system based on cameras and motion sensors.

The system was capable of:

turning watering systems on/off
turning the lights up/down depending on human presence and time of day 
room specific heating and cooling
making coffee at set times with no input
security system based on motion sensors and thermal sensors
turned appliance plugs off when not in use depending on time of day (night)

It made decisions on what to do and how to time them with buttons that set “states,” for example when waking up you would press the button on your night stand to let the system know you woke up at which point the lights slowly turn on and the coffee machine starts brewing your coffee.

It had such “states” for leaving the house, entering the house, waking up and falling asleep.</span><span class="v2_3">Smart Home Automation</span></div></div></body></html>
